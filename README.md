This repository contains: 
1) a tidy data set, tidy.txt
2) a mean tidy data set, mean.txt, calculate averages of every column by subject and activity
3) a script for performing the analysis, run_analysis.R 
4) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
